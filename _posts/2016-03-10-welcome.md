# A fresh start #

Welcome to the brand new website devoteed to people who play the famous
tabletop football game - Subbuteo - in North Wales! If that doesn't get
your pulse racing, I don't know what will!

Anyway, this has been a plan for a while, but only just materialised.
Subbuteo has long been a staple in North East Wales, with Flintshire once
boasting the largest Subbuteo club in the UK, along with several
larger-than-life characters.

"The new era" will begin with the [Wrexham Open Cup 2016](/opencup2016/)
which will hopefully become an annual event. Depending on the success of
that venture, we might even expand to having a bit of a North Wales league!

Anyway, keep checking this exciting website for more news - or more likely,
stumble upon this website and see news that hasn't been updated for heaven
knows how long!

There may also be the occasional article on here, mostly reproduced from the
club's contributions to new UK table football magazine 'Grande Subbuteo'.
Again, it's quite a treat, I'm sure you'll agree.
